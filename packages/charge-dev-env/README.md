### Documentations & Testing

### Linting

ESLint + Prettier + Stylelint is very good combo to keep project as high quality, clean and maintainable.

Note: _If you install Plug-ins of these linters to your Editor, works without any commands at editor level with good performance_

```bash
npm lint
```
