# Next.js Dev Env

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/dalisoft/nextjs-dev-env.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project is modified and prepared as Development Environment for Frontend development with Netlify support. This project may support SSR, but we do not recommend using SSR, would be best using Netlify Prerendering which works fast and elegant for now (hope in future too works great like now)

## Target of project

- Better error logs when `npm run stage` than original `next.js`
- React PropTypes instead of TypeScript
- Latest dependecies (stable)
- i18n support configured
- Prettier configured
- Stylelint configured
- VS Code configuration configured (for best performance)
- Using React PropTypes
- Redaction instead of Redux dispatching (easy & fun)
- Client-side only (no SSR)
- Netlify support
- Github Pages support (via `npm run deploy`)
- Fetch is preferred
- NPM is preferred (because of dependecies resolve)
- Components are documented with react-styleguidist (with basic example)
- Components are tests with react-test-renderer and Jest (with basic example)
- Good browser support
- Good structured (subjective)

**Note**: _Installed `react-scripts` as temporarily workaround to pass tests, other way i tried, but didn't worked, i hope and wait tests integration with Jest from `next.js` community_

For more information/docs, please check `next.js` docs/repository
